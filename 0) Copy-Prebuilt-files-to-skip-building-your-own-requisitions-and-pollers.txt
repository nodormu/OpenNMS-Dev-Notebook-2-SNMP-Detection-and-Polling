3) Add my prebuilt XML files from all my OpenNMS notebooks for a quicker dev experience in testing OpenNMS.

If you want to quickly beef up your requisition and polled services list, then place my provided XML files in the foreign-sources_pending folder into their corresponding folder in the OpenNMS installation.
In debian or other linux distro, it should be /etc/opennms, /opt/opennms or wherever you chose to install it.

The poller-configuration.xml can replace the default one created after the fresh installation.
The XML files in the foreign-sources_pending folder can be copied into the /etc/opennms/foreign-sources/pending folder or wherever this folder is for your OpenNMS installation.
This should work fine with Windows as well, but I haven't tested a windows installation of OpenNMS yet, mostly because I prefer linux.

After you copy these files in place, restart opennms services and related child processes.


You will have to google how to setup SNMP for whatever device it is you want OpenNMS to monitor.
If you are using SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, ALWAYS use a custom string. Don't use testpub as used in the snmp-config.xml in the fresh OpenNMS installation, and don't use public or private either. Make something up and document it.
For polling/security setting on your device, set the community string you made up and use the static IP of the OpenNMS server.
For traps, you set the community and the IP of the OpenNMS server up on your device.

Be sure you setup the files in the OpenNMS notebook 1 first, before doing this notebook, otherwise your events, traps and data collection will be a complete mess and useless.
